Software development models refer to structured approaches for designing,developing and delivering software. 
These models guide the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). 
Some of the most commonly used software models are:
1.Waterfall Model
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
It is based on Requirements,Design,Implementation,Testing,Deployment,Maintenance.
Easy to understand and manage;structured.
Inflexible;changes are costly and difficult to implement once a phase is completed.

2.V-Model (Verification and Validation)
An extension of the Waterfall model,where each development stage is associated with a corresponding testing phase.
It works based on Requirements (Verification),Design (Validation),Coding,Testing,Maintenance.
Emphasizes testing early in the development process.
Not flexible for changes;testing may be too late to catch major design flaws.

3.DevOps Model
Aims to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).It emphasizes collaboration,automation and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Faster delivery,frequent updates and continuous feedback loops.
Requires cultural change and high levels of automation,can be challenging to scale.

4.Agile Model
Agile is a set of principles for software development rather than a strict model.
It focuses on iterative development,flexibility,customer collaboration and delivering small but valuable increments.
Flexibility,customer focus,rapid delivery.
Requires high customer involvement,can be difficult to maintain a consistent product vision.
